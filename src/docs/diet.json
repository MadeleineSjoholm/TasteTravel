	"vegan": "No ingredients may contain meat or meat by-products, such as bones or gelatin, nor may they contain eggs, dairy, or honey.",
	"gluten": "Eliminating gluten means avoiding wheat, barley, rye, and other gluten-containing grains and foods made from them (or that may have been cross contaminated).",
	"lacto": "All ingredients must be vegetarian and none of the ingredients can be or contain egg.",
	"ovo": "All ingredients must be vegetarian and none of the ingredients can be or contain dairy.",
	"pesc": "Everything is allowed except meat and meat by-products - some pescetarians eat eggs and dairy, some do not.",
	"keto":  "The keto diet is based more on the ratio of fat, protein, and carbs in the diet rather than specific ingredients. Generally speaking, high fat, protein-rich foods are acceptable and high carbohydrate foods are not.",
	"paleo": "Allowed ingredients include meat (especially grass fed), fish, eggs, vegetables, some oils (e.g. coconut and olive oil), and in smaller quantities, fruit, nuts, and sweet potatoes. We also allow honey and maple syrup (popular in Paleo desserts, but strict Paleo followers may disagree). Ingredients not allowed include legumes (e.g. beans and lentils), grains, dairy, refined sugar, and processed foods.",
	"primal": "Very similar to Paleo, except dairy is allowed - think raw and full fat milk, butter, ghee, etc.",

  "italy": "Italian cuisine has influenced food culture around the world and is viewed as a form of art by many. Wine, cheese and pasta are important part of Italian meals. Pasta comes in a wide range of shapes, widths and lengths, including penne, spaghetti, linguine, fusilli and lasagna.",
  "italy2": "For Italians, food isn't just nourishment, it is life. Family gatherings are frequent and often centered around food and the extended networks of families, said Wagner. No one area of Italy eats the same things as the next. Each region has its own spin on Italian food, according to CNN. For example, most of the foods that Americans view as Italian, such as spaghetti and pizza, come from central Italy. In the North of Italy, fish, potatoes, rice, sausages, pork and different types of cheeses are the most common ingredients. Pasta dishes with tomatoes are popular, as are many kinds of stuffed pasta, polenta and risotto. In the South, tomatoes dominate dishes, and they are either served fresh or cooked into sauce. Southern cuisine also includes capers, peppers, olives and olive oil, garlic, artichokes, eggplant and ricotta cheese.",
  "italy3": " Wine is also a big part of Italian culture, and the country is home to some of the world's most famous vineyards. The oldest traces of Italian wine were recently discovered in a cave near Sicily's southwest coast. The archaeological implications of this new data are enormous, especially considering that the identification of wine [is] the first and earliest-attested presence of such product in an archaeological context in Sicily, researchers wrote in the study, published online August 2017 in the Microchemical Journal."
