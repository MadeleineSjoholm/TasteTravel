# XSS and CSRF attacks

### XSS Attacks
XSS attacks are attacks when hackers injects malicious scripts into a trusted website. They are usually most successful on websites that allows user input without validating or encoding it. The browsers the user uses does not know what scripts are malicious and what scripts are not, making the end user unsuspecting of the attack. XSS could be very dangerous, since it does not need any user interaction.

### CSRF Attacks
A CSRF attack however, tricks the victim to perform tasks on websites they are authenticated to that they would not necessarily do. Social engineering if often used in CSRF attacks. For example, links in emails can trick a user into sending a forger request to a server. Though, a CSRF attack is restricted only to the actions that the user can perform.
